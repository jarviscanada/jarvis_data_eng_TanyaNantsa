# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # Please read the project description guideline carefully. Make sure you follow the simplified SDLC pattern. (t.ly/NlXQ)
    # Please include the following keywords: CentOS, Bash/Shell, docker, RDBMS/SQL/Postgresql, crontab, data analytics
    description: The Linux cluster monitoring project resolves the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team?s need to manage a Linux cluster of 10 servers running CentOS 7. The project collects and stores real-time hardware specifications and resource usage data for each server in a database, enabling the LCA team to generate reports and use data analytics to make informed decisions about server additions or removals. The technologies used include Docker for the containerized deployment of the PostgreSQL database instance, Bash scripts for the data parsing and data collection on individual servers, PostgreSQL for the database, crontab for automating the bash script that collects resource usage data, and Git for version control and feature management within the project.

      #     #Keywords: Java 8, REST API, OAuth, Design patterns (e.g. DAO, MVC), JUnit, Mockito, Docker
      #     - "Twitter CRUD App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam."
      # Keywords: Java 8, JDBC, RDBMS, SQL, CRUD,DAO
      - "JDBC App: The Stock Quote Application is a Java-based application that simulates a simple stock wallet where users buy and sell stocks. The app fetches stock quotes from an external API (Alpha Vantage REST API) and store them in a PostgreSQL database. The Java application leverages Maven for various tasks such as building the project, managing dependencies, enforcing project structure, and cleaning artifacts. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connects the application to the PostgreSQL database. The application has Data Access Object classes like QuoteDao and PositionDao, which handle tasks like saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting stock quote data from the PostgreSQL database. Additionally, Docker is utilized to create a Docker image for the application, which is then pushed to Docker Hub for distribution and deployment. Finally, JUnit and Mockito are used for automated testing."
      # Keywords: Java 8, Lambda, Stream API, IntelliJ
      - "Grep App: The Grep Java application behaves similarly to the Linux grep command, identifying string patterns within files and returning lines containing the matching pattern. The application, implemented with Java 8, utilized Maven for building the Java project (including compiling code and packaging artifacts), managing dependencies, enforcing a consistent project structure, and cleaning the package artifacts in the project. IntelliJ IDE facilitated code editing, running, and debugging. Lambda and Stream API enhanced the application, integrating lazy evaluations and concise code for increased readability. Finally, Docker was employed to build a Docker image for the app and then push the image to Docker Hub."
