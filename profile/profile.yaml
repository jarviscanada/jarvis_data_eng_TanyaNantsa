    description: The Linux cluster monitoring project resolves the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team's need to manage a Linux cluster of 10 servers running CentOS 7. The project collects and stores real-time hardware specifications and resource usage data for each server into a database, enabling the LCA team to generate reports and use data analytics to make informed decisions about server additions or removals. The technologies used include Docker for the containerized deployment of the PostgreSQL database instance, Bash scripts for the data parsing and data collection on individual servers, PostgreSQL for the database, crontab for automating the bash script that collects resource usage data, and Git for version control and feature management within the project.
